# Demo-iDAAS-Connect-FHIR
Demo of iDAAS Connect FHIR capabilities, this solution is intended to enable resources to get up and running and build
a quick understanding of the iDAAS Connect FHIR overall capabilities. iDAAS has several key components that provide many 
capabilities. .To get the latest 
FHIR Resource support please go to the Connected Health/iDAAS 
<a href="https://www.connectedhealth-idaas.io/home/SupportedTransactions" target="_blank">
Supported Transactions page</a>. Currently, we support almost 80 FHIR Resources!!! In order to 
support features like searching a FHIR Server will be required. The iDAAS-Connect-FHIR component 
does fully support integrating to external vendor FHIR server, look in the running section 
below for more details and specifics. If you are concerned and wonder "what bundles do they support?" the answer is we do
not differentiate and can process daat contained within bundles or directly as resources.

## Additional Artifacts/Apps/Data
This solution contains three supporting directories. The intent of these artifacts to enable
resources to work locally: <br/>
+ platform-addons: add-ons potentially needed. We include the AMQ-Streams release here just in case its needed. We
have also included an additional file that has the settings if you are running IBM's FHIR server locally. Lastly, we have
included an export of the workspace we have internally created within <a href="https://insomnia.rest/products/core/" target="_blank">
Insomnia core</a>. The intent is to help by providing an export as a quick start to help. Simply import the server.xml file within the Insomnia-APITesting 
+ platform-scripts: support running kafka, All of these are only intended to try and help developers if they are learning
about AMQ-Streams (Kafka), we have included some base scripts for creating/listing and deleting topics needed for this solution
and also building and packaging the solution as well. All the scripts are named to describe their capabilities. <br/>
+ platform-testdata: sample transactions to leverage for using the platform. We have included FHIR message samples.

## Scenario: Integration 
This repository follows a very common general facility based implementation. Below is a visual intended to help show a general data flow so as you read the steps it
becomes clearer how all the iDaaS accelerator components work together. <br/>

### Integration Data Flow Steps
This data flow is a sample flow based on real world usage and needs. When the iDAAS-Connect-FHIR starts it 
creates a servlet endpoint per defined FHIR Resource
that can be leveraged immediately. To date the iDAAS-Connect-FHIR component fully supports all
the FHIR resource needs for CMS Interoperability Final Rule including support for USCD1.
FHIR Servers and has been tested with multiple FHIR servers.<br/>
<b>How would I connect to iDAAS-Connect-FHIR to post data to it?</b><br/>
<i>Every FHIR supported resource is in lower case.</i> This example is based on the default 
configuration of iDAAS with no advanced configuration or HTTPS endpoints being enabled. For example, 
if the iDAAS-Connect-FHIR 
is running on localhost and you are trying to work with a FHIR Condition resource then 
the URL would be http://localhost/8080/condition.
 
1. We use Insomnia Core, a well know API testing tool, to connect to the specific FHIR resource endpoint within the 
running instance of iDAAS-Connect-FHIR. 
2. iDAAS-Connect-FHIR audits the inbound data.
3. iDAAS-Connect-FHIR then processes the data to/from the configured FHIR server
4. iDAAS-Connect-FHIR then processes the FHIR server response and audits it as well. 
    
# Start The Engine!!!
This section covers the running of the solution. There are several options to start the Engine Up!!!

## Step 1: Kafka Server To Connect To
In order for ANY processing to occur you must have a Kafka server running that this accelerator is configured to connect to.
Please see the following files we have included to try and help: <br/>
[Kafka](https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/iDaaS-Demos/blob/master/Kafka.md)<br/>
[KafkaWindows](https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/iDaaS-Demos/blob/master/KafkaWindows.md)<br/>

## Step 2: Running the App: Maven or Code Editor
This section covers how to get the application started.
+ Maven: go to the directory of where you have this code. Specifically, you want to be at the same level as the POM.xml file and execute the
following command: <br/>
```
mvn clean install
 ```
Depending upon if you have every run this code before and what libraries you have already in your local Maven instance it could take a few minutes.
+ Code Editor: You can right click on the Application.java in the /src/<application namespace> and select Run
### Design Pattern/Accelerator Configuration
All iDaaS Design Pattern/Accelelrators have application.properties files to enable some level of reusability of code and simplfying configurational enhancements.<br/>
In order to run multiple iDaaS integration applications we had to ensure the internal http ports that
the application uses. In order to do this we MUST set the server.port property otherwise it defaults to port 8080 and ANY additional
components will fail to start. iDaaS Connect HL7 uses 9980. You can change this, but you will have to ensure other applications are not
using the port you specify.

## Customizing the Implementation - Application Properties 
Alternatively, if you have a running instance of Kafka, you can start a solution with:
`./platform-scripts/start-solution-with-kafka-brokers.sh --idaas.kafkaBrokers=host1:port1,host2:port2`.
The script will startup iDAAS server.

It is possible to overwrite configuration by:
1. Providing parameters via command line e.g.
2. Leverage the respective application.properties file in the correct location to ensure the properties are properly set
To use with a custom location `./start-solution.sh --spring.config.location=file:./config/application.properties`. However,
if you run from a Java IDE or from any command line that just invokes the jar it will automatically pull the application.properties
file in the resources directory closest to the jar file.

As you look at the properties the idaas.fhirVendor on startup determines the FHIR Server that would be
leveraged:
idaas.fhirVendor=ibm
idaas.fhirVendor=hapi
idaas.fhirVendor=microsoft

Supported properties include:
```
idaas.kafkaBrokers=localhost:9092 #a comma separated list of kafka brokers e.g. host1:port1,host2:port2
idaas.fhirVendor=ibm
idaas.ibmURI=http://localhost:8090/fhir-server/api/v4/
idaas.hapiURI=http://localhost:8080/hapi/api/v4/
idaas.msoftURI=http://localhost:9999/microsoftapi/api/v4/
```

# Testing
We have made a recent change to leverage Insomnia Core for testing APIs.  Leverage the files included in the 
platforms-addons/Insomnia-APITesting directory of this repository.

# Kafka
We have removed the detailed scripts that used to do numerous operations and activities as these are now mostly  
supported within the Kafka technology natively.<br>

## FHIR Servers
The platform is all about working with other technologies as needed. Please following the following links for any
specifics to the two leading FHIR Servers we have implemented and tested with: <br/>
